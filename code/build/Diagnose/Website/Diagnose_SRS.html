        <p class="paragraph">
          HIV-1 is a virus that attacks cells of the immune system needed to fight off diseases. The virus leads to an uncurable disease called AIDs. Therefore, it is useful to have a program to model these types of problems. The program documented here is called Diagnose.

          The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Diagnose. This section explains the purpose of this document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended reader, and the organization of the document.
